Urea 	134 	18
SSP 	250 	33
MOP	 67 	9

Method of Fertilizer Application:
1.FYM or compost should be applied during land preparation.
The entire quantity of SSP and MOP and half of the total urea is
to be applied in furrows (8-10 cm deep) and covered with 4-5
cm of soil. Sowing of seed should be done at least 2 days after
fertilizer application.

2.The remaining half of urea should be top dressed in two equal
doses followed by earthing up; in each case. The first ¼ at 35
days after germination or when the plants are at knee high stage
and the second ¼ at the tassel initiation stage of the crop i.e.
45-60 days after germination or at the time of elongation of the
flag leaf whichever is earlier. The fertilizer should be applied on
both sides of row and weeds should also be removed from the
field during this operation. However, before application of the
fertilizer a light hoeing is to be given between the lines 2-3 days
ahead.

Plant Protection:
When infestation of stem borer is noticed, fenitrothion 50 EC
@ 1.0 lit/ha in 200-250 litres of water should be sprayed with
power sprayer or in 700-800 litres of water with hand sprayer.
Alternatively, endosulfan 1.5 lit/ha should be sprayed with the
same volume of water.
In areas where banded sclerotial disease (Rhizoctonia solani)
is noticed, the plants should be sprayed with carbendazim
0.05% (0.5 g/lit water) @ 700 lit/ha of spray solution at an
interval of 12-15 days. Matured cobs can be protected from
bird damage by tying cobs with leaves of the same plant.
