Urea 	31	 4
SSP 	220	 30

Time of Application of Fertilizers:
The quantity of N is to be reduced proportionately to the quantity
of N added in the form of FYM (each tonne of FYM contributes
about 5 kg N).
Diammonium phosphate (DAP) @ 75 kg/ha or 10 kg/bigha may
be applied in lieu of urea and SSP in non inoculated crop.

Plant Protection Measures Against Diseases : 
i) Leaf spot (Cercospora spp) : 
	As soon as disease appears
	spray copper oxychloride @ 0.3% (1.8-2.0 kg in 600-700 lit
	of water/ha) at an interval of 7-10 days. Alternatively
	carbendazim @ 0.05% (300-350g in 600-700 lit of water/ha)
	at an interval of 12-15 days should be sprayed.
ii) Blight (Rhizoctonia solani): 
	On appearance of this disease
	carbendazim @ 0.05% should be sprayed as stated above. It
	will also control leaf spot and powdery mildew diseases.
	Rhizoctonia solani induced damping off, root rot and seedling
	blight can be effectively managed by seed treatment with slurry
	method using commercial formulations of Trichoderma spp. @
	5 g/kg of seed.
