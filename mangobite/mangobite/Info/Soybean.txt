Time of Application of Fertilizers:
1.Potash is required for healthy development of seeds. Foliar
application of MOP is recommended in soils with low potash
content.

2.Fertilizer should be placed in furrows at a depth of 5 to 7 cm
below the seeds and should be covered with a layer of 3-4 cm
soil and make it level with the field. In case placement is not
possible, the fertilizers should be evenly broadcast and
incorporated in the soil.


Plant Protection Measures Against Diseases:
A.Diseases:
Soybean seeds should be treated with Thiram @ 3 g/kg of seed.
Soybean is susceptible to yellow mosaic virus. In order to stop
spread of the vector of yellow mosaic disease in field, spray
dimethoate 30 EC @ 1 to 1.51 in 800 to 1000 l water/ha.
Rhizoctonia solani induced dry root rot in soybean can be
effectively managed by seed treatment with Trichoderma spp
by slurry method @ 5 g/kg of seed.
