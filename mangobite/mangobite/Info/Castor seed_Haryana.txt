Time of Application of Fertilizers:
The quantity of N is to be reduced proportionately to the quantity
of N added in the form of FYM (each tonne of FYM contributes
about 5 kg N). Diammonium phosphate (DAP) 75 kg/ha or 10
kg/bigha should be applied in lieu of urea and SSP in non
inoculated crops.


Plant Protection Measures Against Diseases :
Leaf spot (Cercospora spp.):
	 As soon as disease appears spray
	copper oxychloride @ 0.3% (1.8 – 2.0 kg/ha in 600-700 lit of
	water) at an interval of 7-10 days. Alternatively carbendazim
	@ 0.05% (300-350 g in 600-700 lit of water/ha) at an interval
	of 12-15 days should be sprayed.

Blight (Rhizoctonia solani):
	 On appearance of this disease
	carbendazim @ 0.05% (300-350 g in 600-700 lit of water/ha)
	should be sprayed. This will control leaf spot and powdery
	mildew disease also.
	Rhizoctonia solani induced damping off, root rot and seedling
	blight can be effectively managed by seed treatment with slurry
	method using commercial formulations of Trichoderma spp. @
	5 g/kg of seeds.
