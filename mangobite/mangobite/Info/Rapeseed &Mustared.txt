Time of Application of Fertilizers:
1. Apply full dose of phosphatic fertilizer at the time of final
ploughing.

2. Apply half of nitrogenous and half of potassic fertilizer 15-
25 days after germination or after first weeding.

3. The second top dressing with the remaining N and K2O is
to be done 40-50 days after germination or after second
weeding.



Plant Protection Measures Against Diseases : 
i) Blast:
a) Grow tolerant varieties, such as Govind, Cauvery, IR 36.
b) Treat the seeds as mentioned under seed treatment.
c) Monitoring of blast is important to schedule spraying.
Observe the top five leaves and if 5% leaf area is damaged,
resort to spraying. Normally three sprays can control the
disease. Spray carbendazim or thiophenate methyl @ 1g/
lit of water at tillering stage (40-55 days after sowing) and
subsequently give two more sprays of ediphenphos @ 1 ml/lit
of water, one at panicle initiation stage and the other when
the tip of the panicle just comes out.


ii) Sheath blight disease:
a) For control of sheath blight disease – spraying of two
commercial plant-derived cymbopogon products viz.
cymbopogon product 20E @ 5 ml/litre and neem product
@ 3 ml/litre is recommended for management of sheath
blight disease of rice. The first spraying should be given as
soon as symptom of the disease is observed in the field
followed by a second spraying at 10 days interval.


iii) Bacterial leaf blight (BLB):
a) Grow tolerant varieties, such as Govind and IR 36.
b) Avoid top dressing with nitrogen at panicle initiation stage
if BLB has already appeared. Instead top dress with 10 kg
of K2O /ha or apply 5 kg of K2O/ha in the form of foliar
spray of 3% solution.


iv) Brown spot disease:
a) Dry (1g/kg of seed) or wet (1g/kg of seed/lit of water) seed
treatment with carbendazim followed by one spraying of
mancozeb @ 2.5 g/litre or ediphenphos @ 1 ml/litre or
carbendazim @ 1g/litre at initial symptom development
stage.


v) Bakanae Disease:
a) Soak seeds for 24 hours with thiophenate-methyl or
carbendazim @ 1g/kg seed/lit of water.
b) Rogue out the infected tillers (elongated, from the infected
hills in the main field).
