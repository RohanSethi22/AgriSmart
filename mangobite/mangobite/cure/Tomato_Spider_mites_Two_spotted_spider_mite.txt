1) Prune leaves, stems and other infested parts of plants well past any webbing and discard in trash (and not in compost piles). Donâ€™t be hesitant to pull entire plants to prevent the mites spreading to its neighbors.
2) Use the Bug Blaster to wash plants with a strong stream of water and reduce pest numbers.
3) Commercially available beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewing and predatory mites are important natural enemies. For best results, make releases when pest levels are low to medium.
